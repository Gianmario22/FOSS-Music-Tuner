<h1>FOSS Music Tuner</h1>
<p>A free and lightweight Chromium extension to tune all your favourite music to any of the standard tuning frequencies.</p>
<p>Forked from VideoPlaybackSpeedEditorExtention by Anmol-Joshi.<br>
https://github.com/Anmol-Joshi/VideoPlaybackSpeedEditorExtention</p>
<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Switching to another song defaults the tuning back to 440 Hz</li>
  <li>The frequency selector doesn't remember the selected frequency for the song that is currently playing</li>
</ul>
<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>Which platforms do support this extension?</h3>
<p>As far as I've noticed, my extension works on both YouTube and YouTube Music, while Spotify and SoundCloud are unsupported at the moment.</p>
<p>Simple audio and video embeds work fine too.</p>
<h3>How do I download this?</h3>
<p>I'm looking forward to publishing the extension on the Chrome Web Store. For the time being you can enable sideloading, download the extension as a .zip or via Git and sideload it using developer mode.</p>
<h3>Is this extension going to be ported to Firefox/Gecko?</h3>
<p>idk</p>
